## Growth Mindset

Having a growth mindset is a key element to becoming a successful programmer. \
Here are some notes on the 'Growth Minset':
- The believing that people's most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.
- Take all the opportunities to be mentored
- Add "..yet" to all "I can't"  sentences
- Using all that you know and being able McGyver a solution
- Replace the word "hard" with "challenging"
